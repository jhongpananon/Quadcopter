/**
 * @{
 * The main parameters are the buffer size, and number of message buffers.
 * The buffer size controls how much data we can cache before we are forced
 * to write it to the output file.
 *
 * The message buffers are the maximum number of LOGGING calls (macros) that can
 * occur at once after which the caller to LOG macro will be blocked.  Note that
 * even a small number like 5 is good enough because as soon as there is time
 * for the logging task to run, it will transfer the LOGGED message into the
 * file buffer immediately.  So this number is kind of like a double buffer.
 *
 * The flush timeout is the timeout after which point we are forced to flush
 * the data buffer to the file.  So in an event when no logging calls occur and
 * there is data in the buffer, we will write it to the file after this time.
